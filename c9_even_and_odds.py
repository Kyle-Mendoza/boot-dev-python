    Evens and Odds
    You’ve been asked to write a program that will calculate how many odd and even numbers exist in a list.

    Challenge
    Write the get_odds_and_evens function to loop through the numbers list and check if each number in the list is either odd or even.

    Increment the num_evens counter if even, and the num_odds counter if it’s odd. Lastly, return the two values num_odds and num_evens in that order.

def get_odds_and_evens(numbers):
    num_odds = 0
    num_evens = 0 

    # Don't touch above this line 
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 1:
            num_odds += 1
        else: 
            num_evens += 1
    
    return num_odds, num_evens
